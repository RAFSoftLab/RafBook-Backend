# RafBook-Backend

## Overview

This is a Java Spring backend for a messaging application that supports real-time communication between students, group channels, notifications, and media sharing. It provides endpoints for managing users, channels, messages, and notifications, with optional video and audio communication support. The backend is designed to support mobile, web, and desktop applications as clients.

# Database Structure

### Tables

- **`users`**: Stores user information, including authentication details.
- **`channels`**: Stores channel information (name, type, associated course or department).

- **`notifications`**: Stores system-wide notifications.
- **`calls`** (optional): Stores data on audio and video calls, if enabled.

# Security

### JWT Authentication
- Used for securing API endpoints, requiring users to authenticate and obtain a JWT token for access.

### Role-Based Access Control
- Roles include **admin**, **professor**, and **student**, each with specific permissions:
  - **Admin**: Full access, including user and channel management.
  - **Professor**: Access to manage channels related to their courses.
  - **Student**: Access to view channels and communicate within allowed channels.

### Password Encryption
- User passwords are securely hashed using **bcrypt** for added security against unauthorized access.

### WebSocket Security
- JWT token authentication is required for establishing WebSocket connections, ensuring only authenticated users have access to real-time messaging.

### MAC Address Verification
- **MAC Address** is required during user registration, adding an extra layer of device-level verification.
